Overview:
This repository contains and uses the code for an open source line-following robot The robot is designed to automatically navigate a path by following a black line on a white surface using infrared sensors.

Hardware Requirements:

Arduino Uno

2 Infrared (IR) sensors

Motor driver

Geared motors

Chassis

Wheels

Power source (batteries)

Software Requirements:

Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

Installation:

Connect the Arduino Uno to your computer using a USB cable.

Open the Arduino IDE.

Copy the contents of line_following_robot.ino into a new sketch in the Arduino IDE.

Verify and upload the sketch to the Arduino Uno.

Usage:

Place the line-following robot on a surface with a black line drawn on a white background.

Power on the robot.

The robot will start following the line autonomously.

Customization:

Adjust the thresholds for the IR sensor readings in the code to optimize line detection based on the surface conditions.
